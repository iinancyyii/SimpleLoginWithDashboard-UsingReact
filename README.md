# SimpleLoginWithDashboard-UsingReact

This is a simple login with routes that redirects to the dashboard page built with React. Several validations are also there in the login page. Dashboard has two routes which is home and posts. Home contains card tiles that rotates when you hover on them which gives a good user experience. Api (axios) calls are also made on both the components to fetch some data. <br/>
Any further suggestions are always welcome!
